## `remarkable doc archive <id-or-name>`

Save a complete native snapshot as a ZIP at an explicit output path.

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--output` | `-o` | `string` | `""` | Required nonempty ZIP destination; preserve every existing path, including a path created during export. |

Require an existing parent with hard-link support. Write a `0600` temporary ZIP
beside the destination; publish only after verification. Export every manifest
entry, requiring `.content`/`.metadata`, with this layout:

- `files/<original-native-name>`: every native attachment with unchanged
  names and bytes, including raw content/metadata, PDF, pagedata, strokes,
  metadata-only strokes, deleted-page files, and unknown attachments present.
- `evidence/document.docSchema`: unchanged document manifest bytes.
- `evidence/snapshot.json`: `format_version` 1, `document_id`,
  `document_hash`, `root` (`hash`, `generation`, `schemaVersion`),
  `manifest_sha256`, and `files` containing `name`, `hash`, `sha256`, `size`.

Raw bytes preserve both page schemas, IDs, PDF redirections, inserted/deleted
state, tags, and viewport settings. Extract `files/` for explicit mappings.
Fetch every file/manifest fresh; verify SHA-256 and sizes, the manifest address
against ordered binary file hashes, and the raw manifest's separate SHA-256.
Pin a fresh root; recheck hash/generation/schema version after download. Any root
change, including another document, fails. Compare later exports for preservation.

Emit `state: verified`, `output`, `document_id`, `document_hash`, `root_hash`,
`generation`, `manifest_sha256`, then agent TSV `NAME`, `HASH`, `SHA256`, `BYTES`.
Success requires complete downloads, hashes, and the final revision check.

Five-minute total timeout. Errors remove temporary data and preserve existing
outputs; export changes no cloud documents, but may renew credentials. Stdout can
fail after ZIP publication: inspect the path before retrying at an unused path.

## `remarkable doc import <destination-uuid>`

Import local v6 `.rm` files into initialized destination pages using a required
mapping. Preserve bytes, layers, coordinates, metadata-only files, destination PDF,
and `.content`; update metadata `lastModified`. Map future and historical ink alike.

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--mapping` | — | `string` | `""` | Required nonempty path to a JSON array mapping native file paths to 0-based destination page indexes. |

Mapping format; paths are absolute or relative to the mapping file's directory:

```json
[
  {"source": "page-000.rm", "page": 0},
  {"source": "page-457.rm", "page": 457}
]
```

Require `source`/`page` per row; extract archives first. Reject unknown fields, empty
mappings, duplicate or invalid indexes, missing files, and malformed blocks. Require
initialized, unique destination IDs: a `doc upload --initialize-pages` document has them
at once; an ordinary upload gets them when opened on the tablet and synced. Existing
handwriting, text, annotations, or unsupported blocks cause page-specific conflicts;
metadata-only destination files may be replaced.

Preflight errors write no cloud data. Stage files/manifests, generation-check the
commit, broadcast, then freshly verify every uploaded byte and document/page
association. Five-minute total timeout.

Emit `state: STATE`, `uploaded: NAME` per verified file (including metadata), and
TSV `PAGE`, `PAGE ID`, `SOURCE`, `STATE` after transfer starts. Read the state
as one of the skill's write states.

Failures exit nonzero; inspect the destination before recovery. Separately test
select/move/erase on a disposable tablet document to establish native editability.
